        hen Cecil Beaton photographed Her Majesty the Queen to mark her Coronation, in 1953, it was – as you might expect
        – in full pomp, with orb and sceptre, crown and robes, her golden throne standing tall amid the grandeur of
        Westminster Abbey… Except, well, it wasn't. The backdrop is fake; a mere image of the place where she was crowned
        queen. The picture was actually shot in a room at Buckingham Palace, with Westminster Abbey represented by a
        theatrical cloth: a stage set on which the Queen plays her part.
